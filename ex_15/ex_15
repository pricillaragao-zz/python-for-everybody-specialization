Instructions

If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages (
  name VARCHAR(128),
  age INTEGER
)

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only
these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Bayley', 23);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ellie', 35);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Rohit', 18);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Meron', 36);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Bony', 40);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Matt', 35);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.

Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other
database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
